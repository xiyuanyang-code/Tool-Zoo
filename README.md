# ToolZoo for Xiyuan Yang

Welcome to my personal collection of tools, projects, and resources. This is a curated list of tools and projects I've developed or contributed to, organized by category for easy browsing.

## Website Structure

The website consists of two main pages:

1. `introduction.html` - Introduction page explaining the purpose and content of this collection
2. `index.html` - Tools list page showcasing all tools in card format with images and tags

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Works well on both desktop and mobile devices
- **Categorized Tools**: Tools are organized into four categories:
  - Blog & Community
  - Small & Efficient Tools
  - Tutorials & Notes
  - Projects
- **Visual Tags**: Each tool card has a colored tag indicating its category
- **Direct Links**: All tools link directly to their GitHub repositories
- **Sidebar Navigation**: Easy navigation between pages

## Tool Card Design

Each tool is displayed as a card with the following elements:
- **Image**: Placeholder image for each tool (using assets/image.png)
- **Tag**: Color-coded tag in the top-right corner indicating the category
- **Title**: Tool name as a link to the GitHub repository
- **Description**: Brief description of the tool's purpose and functionality

## Color Scheme

The website uses a consistent color scheme for categorization:
- **Blog & Community**: Blue (#1976d2 for tags, #e3f2fd for backgrounds)
- **Small & Efficient Tools**: Green (#388e3c for tags, #e8f5e9 for backgrounds)
- **Tutorials & Notes**: Yellow/Amber (#f57f17 for tags, #fff8e1 for backgrounds)
- **Projects**: Purple (#7b1fa2 for tags, #f3e5f5 for backgrounds)
